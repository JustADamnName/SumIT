# SumIT
A hobby website that I use to outsource my memory for the BIT degree, so I can self-learn if I forget anything.

(built with HTML + CSS + Bootstrap)

Additionally, it would also help others IT students to learn much more efficiently.

Features involved:

_ JavaScript is used to validate log-in details (username and password must both be >6 characters)

_ Web Storage (index.html)

_ Geolocation (Contact.html)

_ Live chat: used Tawk.to in Self-help.html

_ Glowing gradient button for index.html

_ Data List in index.html and Contact.html to allow faster user input

_ Flexbox + Media Queries to ensure all pages are perfectly responsive for all devices, whether landscape and portrait.
